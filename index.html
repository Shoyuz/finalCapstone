              />
              Tanzania is home to the famous <b>Maasai Tribe</b>. A semi nomadic
              pastoral tribe that to this day and age, moves around the land
              with their livestock in search of fresh pasture and water. You
              will not miss them as they dont dress up like me and you! Their
              traditional bright red garments with distinct checked pattern
              marks are rolled over their bodies and tightened by a belt around
              the waist (or a dark purple garment for the women) set them apart
              from the other folks around them. The tribe is found in the
              Northern part of Tanzania which also happens to be home to some of
              the most breath taking and wilidlife reach areas found anywhere in
              the world! You will also not miss their distinct round huts which
              they call <i>Bomas</i>. These are temporary shelters created out
              of a mix of mud and cow dung for the walls, sticks for the
              structure and grass for the thatched roof. If you want to get a
              glimpse of life inside a Maasai Boma, then be sure to stop by one.
              You will get a hands on experience of what it is living like a
              Maasai.

              If you are a fan of wildlife documentaries then you will have most
              definitely heard about the great endless plains of the
              Serengeti.It is home to the world's largest annual migration of
              wild animals where over a million wildebeest,Zebras and other
              antelopes traverse south to North and vice versa through the vast
              expansive plains in search of fresh grass and water.It is a
              journey that the herds undertake inorder to survive,but along the
              journey,the herds face all kinds of dangers from predators lying
              in wait for the herds to arrive and for the feast to begin.It is a
              must see natural spectacle.<br />

            Home of the worlds largest intact Caldera,The Ngorongoro Crater
          </h3>
          <p>
            Measuring an area of 260 square kilometres and extending about 20km
            in diameter, the crater is actually a huge caldera of a volcano that
            collapsed to a depth of 610m about three million years ago. Over the
            course of time, streams of water made their way down the crater to
            form little ponds, and vegetation developed all over, attracting a
            wide range of wild animals. The crater is host to over 25,000
            animals including populations of large mammals such as elephants,
            buffaloes, elands, wildebeests, zebras, gazelles, hippos, and
            rhinos, as well as such carnivores as lions, hyenas, jackals, and
            cheetahs.
