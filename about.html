        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          My roots as a passionate wildlife enthusiast, originate from my
          country of birth, Tanzania. Having being born and raised in Tanzania
          before moving to the United KingdoM, i was lucky enough to grow up
          surrounded by the untammed African wilderness. My experiences as a
          child growing up in rural Tanzania have always stayed with me to this
          day and have helped shape me into who i am today. I love everything
          connected with the African wilderness; the animals, the birds, the
          insects , the plants and the people. Being out there in the wild and
          connecting with nature, is an experience that everyone of us should
          have in our life time. It reminds us of who we are, where we have come
          from, and why it is critical to preserve and protect our precious
          wilderness areas. We owe it to the next generation to have the chance
          to experience and see these wonders of nature that our generation is
          blessed with, and more than ever before these precious wildlife
          resources are under immesnse pressure of survival from our ever
          growing population and the competition for resources. My mission is to
          showcase to you some of the of most magnificient wilderness areas in
          my country of birth, Tanzania.
